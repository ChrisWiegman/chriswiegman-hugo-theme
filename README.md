# Chris Wiegman's Hugo Theme

This repo contains the Hugo theme for ChrisWiegman.com.

## Usage

Your best option for using this theme, if you like the current style, is to download the code and copy it into your hugo `themes` directory. This will ensure that, as I inevitably change it, you won't get behind.

The alternative is to install it as a submodule or go module per the [Hugo documentation](https://gohugo.io/documentation/).
